## Sampling groups of Pauli operators to enhance Direct Fidelity Estimation

This repository contains the implementation of benchmarking experiments for Direct Fidelity Estimation (DFE) with and without Pauli operator grouping, as presented in the preprint “arXiv:2501.19228”.

Our evaluation demonstrates the performance of the Sorted Insertion grouping technique on 8-qubit Haar-random states as well as well-structured states, aiming to estimate the fidelity between an unknown experimental state and the true state. The results show that grouping Pauli operators leads to a significant reduction in the number of required copies, enabling more precise fidelity estimates compared to the standard DFE method.
